## Overview

This project involved replicating a design layout given for desktop and mobile for a Easybank Landing Page with special features.

### My Process

I began by setting up TailwindCSS, ReactJS, and my GitHub repository. Additionally, I configured the README template, added all design assets, integrated Google Fonts, and defined the color scheme. I ensured that all commits were successfully pushed to GitHub before beginning my project.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

There are several things I learned throughout this project:

1. **Gradient Colors** 

### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about TailwindCSS, ReactJS and updating my process of building a website. I want to specifically work on learning more TailwindCSS design properties to add to my coding toolbox.

### Useful resources

- [Public Sans Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) - Design called for this font in the project.
- [Gradient Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gradient-color-stops) - This style from TailwindCSS allows for gradients colors.
